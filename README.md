# scRNASeq_analysis_ANCA
 Main scripts used in the analysis of the single-cell RNA-seq data of ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis as described in [Vegting et al., 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.13.584866v1.full). The scripts can be found in ./scRNASeq/Processing/20221220_AllSamples_v4/Code.

The general organization of this repository follows (an earlier version) of the guidelines and structure of our [recently published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52446-8) environment for reproducible computational research (Van Kampen, Mahamune et al., ENCORE: a practical implementation to improve reproducibility and transparency of computational research, Nature Communications, 2024). However, only the relevant code can be found in this repository.
