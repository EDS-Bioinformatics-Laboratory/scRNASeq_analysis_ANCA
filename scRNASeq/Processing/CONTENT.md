### Directory content

**20221220_AllSamples_v4/Code**
This directory contains the final analysis of the single-cell RNA-seq data.
The analysis scripts are numbered, so the order of execution should be clear.
The script 'analysis.r' sources the first 10 scripts leading to the final data set, on which various post-analyses have been performed.

Some scripts have been updated in the process and contain an extra date in their filename.
Some other scripts have been removed here, as they have not been used in the final publication.

**20221220_AllSamples_v4/Data**
This directory contains some extra files in the 'Meta' directory that have been used for the additional analyses performed
