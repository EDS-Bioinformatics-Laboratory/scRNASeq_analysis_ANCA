**Filename conventions**



* The names of each sub-directory should be used to achieve harmonization between the various research and support projects.
  * Exception is the DataAnalyses subfolder, which can be given a name appropriate for the type of analysis (e.g., 23032020_GeneSetEnrichment)



**General conventions**

- A good format for date designations is YYYYMMDD. This format makes sure all of your files stay in chronological order, even over the span of many years.

- Try not to make file names too long, since long file names do not work well with all types of software.

- Special characters such as ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ` ; < > ? , [ ] { } ' " and | should be avoided.

- When using a sequential numbering system, using leading zeros for clarity and to make sure files sort in sequential order. For example, use "001, 002, ...010, 011 ... 100, 101, etc." instead of "1, 2, ...10, 11 ... 100, 101, etc."

- Do not use spaces. Some software will not recognize file names with spaces, and file names with spaces must be enclosed in quotes when using the command line. Other options include:

- - Underscores, e.g. file_name.xxx
  - Dashes, e.g. file-name.xxx
  - No separation, e.g. filename.xxx
  - Camel case, where the first letter of each section of text is capitalized, e.g. FileName.xxx


* Avoid using spaces and other symbols in your filenames. Dashes and Underscores are allowed.



**Naming versions**

When creating new versions of your files, record what changes are being made to the files and give the new files a unique name. Consider the following:

- Include a version number, e.g "v1," "v2," or "v2.1".
- Include information about the status of the file, e.g. "draft" or "final," as long as you don't end up with confusing names like "final2" or "final_revised".
- Include information about what changes were made, e.g. "cropped" or "normalized".
